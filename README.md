# These are my localStorage notes from CHapter 14 of Book 2

## Added notes from Meg's Lecture on 7/17

Essentially, this is the beginning of my delving into JSON. Contained within main.js are the simple functions to add data to local storage, and retrieve data from local storage. More notes to come, as understanding develops.


I sincerly hope.
